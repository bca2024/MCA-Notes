# 3. `$_SESSION` in PHP:

`$_SESSION` is a **superglobal variable** in PHP used to store data across multiple pages during a user's visit to a website. 

### Key Points:
1. **What It Does**  
   - It keeps track of user information (like login status or preferences) as they navigate through your site.
   - The data is stored on the server, and each user has a unique **session ID**.

2. **How It Works**  
   - You start a session using `session_start()`.
   - You can then store data in the `$_SESSION` variable like this:
     ```php
     $_SESSION['username'] = 'John';
     ```
   - The data remains available until the session ends (e.g., when the user logs out or closes the browser).

3. **Why Use It?**  
   - Unlike cookies, session data is not stored on the user's computer, making it more secure for sensitive information.
   - Useful for tasks like keeping a user logged in or managing a shopping cart.

4. **Example:**
   ```php
   <?php
   // Start the session
   session_start();

   // Store data in the session
   $_SESSION['username'] = 'Alice';
   $_SESSION['loggedIn'] = true;

   // Access session data
   echo "Welcome, " . $_SESSION['username'];
   ?>
   ```

### Analogy:  
Imagine youâ€™re at a theme park, and you get a wristband when you enter (session ID). The park keeps your information (like tickets bought, food orders, etc.) in their system linked to your wristband. When you leave the park, all your data is cleared. This is how `$_SESSION` works!
